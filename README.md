# SpinningEarthAR
Lots TODO. Right now it just renders the Earth with an orbiting Spitfire over a black background. Textures and shading are working. Model transforms are working: Earth spins, plane orbits, propeller spins independently.

## Next steps:
1. Read in frames: video or webcam 
2. Render full screen quad or tri so that frame takes up whole screen 
3. Render 3D models in front of frame 
4. Detect right hand position 
5. Translate models to position of hand (depth)? 
6. Optimise
